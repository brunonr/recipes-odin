    <h1>The Real Mojito</h1>
    <img src="img/therealmojito.jpg" width="500px" height="500px">
    <p>This is an authentic recipe for mojito. I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. </p>
    <p>If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>½ medium lime, cut into 3 wedges, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup ice cubes, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 ½ fluid ounces white rum</li>
        <li>½ cup club soda, or as needed</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass. Use a muddler and crush to release mint oils and lime juice.</li>
        <li>Add remaining lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.</li>
        <li>Fill the glass almost to the top with ice.</li>
        <li>Pour in rum and fill the glass with club soda.</li>
        <li>Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired.</li>
    </ol>
